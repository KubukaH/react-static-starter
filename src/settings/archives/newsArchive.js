     title: "Basilwizi hands over state of the art computers to Binga community Library",
     content: <>
       <p>
        On the 27th of October 2011, Basilwizi handed over the Public Access Point (PAP) at Binga Library to Binga Rural District Council in a bid to improve information access in the district. Basilwizi is an organisation operating in Binga with an objective of developing Tonga communities. It has taken over the Tonga.Online project after it was realised that its funding base has dwindled. The Public Access Point will afford the local community access to information through internet services. The Binga Rural District Council accommodated the PAP facilities in the community library for convenience of the local population.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tonga.Online project was started in 2001 and experienced some management problems in early 2011. It was taken over by Basilwizi who today have seen it good to hand over the PAP facilities to the Rural District Council to provide for true ownership. Basilwizi have decided to make this project a prerogative of the Rural District Council. Thus, ten computers were handed over.

         Speaking on behalf of the Austria-Zimbabwe Friendship Association (AZFA), the visiting IT expert Rupi Ruprechtsberger explained how Information Technology could play a crucial role in cultural development of the BaTonga people.
       </p>
       <p>
         “We have deliberately named the project website ‘Mulonga’ because of its reference to the flowing waters of the Zambezi River, which means, the Tonga culture is not a static entity of the past but something which develops over time,” said Rupi.
       </p>
       <p>
         “The Public Access Point is therefore important in linking the world with the Tonga culture and the Tonga culture with the world”, he added. He assured the key stakeholders present that AZFA will continue providing backup services for the ICT centres established in the district including PAP facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
         The Assistant District Administrator, Mr Mugoriya, also attended the ceremony. In his speech he said, “the Public Access Point with its computers and possible future internet connections are crucial in demystifying the myths about the Tonga culture on the internet, the PAP is therefore a very crucial thing to the community around”. He told the gathering of about 200 people that a lot of negative things have been said about Tonga culture. With the connection to the Internet, Mr Mugoriya said the world will be assured of true stories about the life of the people of The Great Valley.
       </p>
       <p>
         The Director of Basilwizi, Frank Mudimba, present during the handover ceremony, emphasised the need for school children to take computer literacy with the zeal it deserves. “The computers that have been handed over to the council are meant to improve and promote information access and sharing with the outside world. We hope the computers will go a long way in improving the education standards and performances in the local schools,” he said. He also encouraged students present to make use of PAP facilities and the text books donated.
       </p>
       <p>
         At the same occasion, Rupi was handing over one of several donated text books to Mr Barnabas B. Munkuli of Binga Rural District Council. These books will be put up in the Community library which houses PAP facilities.

        Community radio creates a space for development and for people to share ideas. With more community radio stations in Zimbabwe people would be "able to talk about the prices of Kapenta fish in the community of Kariba, price of timber in the community of Tsholotsho, the price of bream in Binga [...]", Programmes Officer for Zimbabwe Association of Community Radio Stations (ZACRAS), Kudzai Kwangwari writes.
       </p>
       <p>
         Community radio is a way of giving people access to information, but also a possibility for people to share knowledge and Kudzai argue that it has a huge potential, including the economically potential referred to in the quote.

         As part of our project trying to enhance access to information for the marginalized communities of the Zambezi Valley, Basilwizi is working to create a space for a community radio station in the valley on the Zimbabwean side of Lake Kariba. Through the Zongwe.Onair project a radio staion is already established on the Zambian side of the lake and the station can be reached (on FM 105.0 MHz) in some areas on the Zimbabwean side as well.

        As a part of the monitoring & evaluation plan in Basilwizi the director attends reflection community meetings and workshops together with the project officers. Director Frank Mudimba attended the recent community reflection meeting in Nenyunga in Gokwe North. “It is very good to be part of these meetings, as you will be able to see the gaps in our work,” says Frank Mudimba.
       </p>
       <p>
         He was pleased to see both the councillor and the local chief attending the reflection meeting. Basilwizi is consistently working to include the local leadership in meetings, trainings and workshops to build good relationships with the local communities and as well entrench the values of Basilwizi in the community for sustainability purposes. A village head at the meeting talked enthusiastically about Basilwizi’s work raising awareness about the constitution and specifically children’s rights. Though Frank was happy to hear the participants praising the efforts of Basilwizi he was also missing some topics in the discussion. “I’m glad that they are praising us for focusing on the teaching of Tonga in schools and for our efforts in raising awareness on the constitution. But I missed a detailed discussion about the residents’ rights to self-expression, their rights to service deliveries, their rights to natural resources and other basic rights,” Frank explains concluding that we still have a lot of work to do in the area.

         Through our Integrated Aquaculture Agriculture Project Basilwizi is supporting the building of fishponds in the local communities in Zambezi Valley. Last month the fishpond in Siabuwa, Binga District, was stocked with fingerlings.Visiting the project, Director Frank Mudimba, met the committed and enthusiastic community members working at the fishpond.
       </p>
       <p>
         “The fish are thriving and we are so excited to watch them swim around in big groups in the afternoon when they come up to the surface,” one of the volunteers explained, when talking to Frank. During the period until harvest the aim of the project is to lose less than 40% of the fish released in the pond. Two months before harvest this pond has only lost 9,7% of the fish. Both the Director and the volunteers are very proud of this achievement and even though the pond is doing very well they are working for further improvement. The fish would benefit from higher water level in the pond.Therefore work has begun on trying to lower the pipes leading water into the pond and thereby increasing the water pressure and raising the water level.

         Paul Muleya (45) is a fisherman from the village Nsungwale in Binga district. He has made the seven hour long journey to meet with Basilwizi and to search for equipment for the group of fishermen he is representing.
       </p>
       <p>
         Paul is the secretary of the local Fish Ware House Management Committee in Binga (Kujatana Kwesu Union). Kujatana Kwesu Union is a group of 47 small fishing co- operations which united in concerted effort to improve the deplorable conditions of most fishermen in Binga District. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Paul lives with his wife Lucia Siambanda (33) and their eight kids. Together they grow crops to sustain the family and Paul goes fishing to earn extra money for the kids’ school fees and other necessities. The family lives in huts with no electricity and with the open fire in the kitchens there is always a fire risk when cooking. “I dream of having a real house. I would like to have a proper stove and be able to have visitors and invite them into a living room and maybe even have a bed for them to sleep in,” Paul explains. 
       </p>
       <p>
         As part of the project the committee will be provided with a cooling truck to collect fish from the many fishing villages around Binga Center. The truck is going to bring the fresh fish to Binga Center and from there they will be shipped to bigger cities. “We need to be able to get the fresh fish to buyers in the bigger cities,” says Paul when I talk to him in the car on the way into town. Together with Paul we drove around Bulawayo to look for equipment for the warehouse. They need a scale that can measure up to 300 kg and is approved by the authorities and they need plastic bags for bringing ice to the fishing villages and a machine to seal the bags. During the afternoon I realize that this is a more complicated task than I anticipated from the beginning. “We (the committee) is working for better conditions for 47 small fishing co-operatives with between ten to fifteen fishermen in each,” Paul explains as he paints the picture of the difficult work the committee is carrying out. It is a difficult task and there is still a long way to go, but in the end it will be worth it, as they will be able to sell their fish at almost double the price in the cities. From spending an afternoon driving around with Paul Muleya I have learned a lot about the conditions of the fishermen and I must say, I have nothing but respect for the hardworking fishermen in Binga.

       On the occasion of the international day of the African child, Basilwizi remembers all those children abused by society, all the girls denied of education and other rights on the basis of culture, tradition, religion or race. 
       </p>
       <p>
       We remember the girl child who is married against their consent, married before age and denied other opportunities in life. Basilwizi Trust, a truly local Zimbabwean NGO, commits itself to defending the Rights of such children and to advancing the realization of every child's dream against all odds. We call upon all elders, law makers, parents and guardians of minors to allow their little angels to shine and fly into the world of opportunities and prosperity.

         “Kulima Mbobumi”, this is one of the common saying in many parts of Binga, meaning to say farming is the vehicle to alleviating poverty and extreme starvation. Farming in Binga, be it fish farming or growing of crops is continuously helping to sustain the livelihoods of the people.
       </p>
       <p>
         Born in a polygamous family with her father having two wives and 12 children, Berita Sibanda (35) Chairperson of the Nzovunde Fishpond Beneficiaries Committee, had to drop out of school at the age of 13 because her parent’s couldn’t afford paying for her education. At the age of 21 she got married to a man who is not educated like she is and now they have three sons together aged nine, six and one. Berita and her husband depend on farming for the sustainability of their family; they grow drought resistant crops like sorghum which are very suitable for the hot weather conditions in Binga. The crops are mainly for consumption but if they have any surplus, they sell and get money for their children.
       </p>
       <p>
         When Basilwizi introduced the fishpond project in Nzovunde I was so happy, I know that once we start harvesting our fish we will be able to improve our household income through fish sales and also improve our  food production” said Berita.
       </p>
       <p>
         Basilwizi Trust is implementing an Integrated Aquaculture Agriculture Project that helps communities to construct fishponds as livelihoods initiatives. The project started in August 2014 and already it has made impact in the community and giving community members like Berita hope for a sustainable living. Nzovunde community members (with the support from Basilwizi) have finished building a fishpond, fingerlings and feeds will be purchased before the end of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
         “The Nzovunde wetlands were unprotected and cattle used to freely drink water from them. Basilwizi brought to us representatives from the Environment Management Agency (EMA) who enlightened us on how to preserve our wetlands so that we can benefit from them” said Berita. After the EMA visit, Nzovunde community members were able to develop their own irrigation, plant vativa grass which holds the soil together to avoid soil erosion and to create a place where cattle drink water from.
       </p>
       <p>
         Berita wishes for her children to have every possibility in life. “I want my children to be educated till the last level all of them want, so that they can also apply their knowledge on sustainable way of farming and also venture into other businesses they would want to” said Berita.

         Chairman of Kujatana Kwesu Union, Kenias Chigwagwa (42) from Moola in Nyaminyami District, is a husband and a father of two girls and one boy. He is currently staying in Binga Centre at the Secondary Suburbs with his family.
       </p>
       <p>
         Kujatana Kwesu Union is a group comprising of fishing cooperatives in Binga working for better conditions for the fishermen in the area. Chigwagwa is grateful for the great work of Basilwizi and he attends Basilwizi activities because the organization has people’s well-being at heart, he says. “We started working with Basilwizi back in 2001 when we (fishermen) were still being attacked by wild animals and harassed by National Parks officials because we used the harbours anywhere. By then we didn’t know that it wasn’t allowed. Basilwizi came along and taught us how to engage with different office bearers. Basilwizi has helped us attend meetings in Harare, Hwange, Gokwe and Nyaminyami on fishermen development issues” Chigwagwa explained. “At first we didn’t have offices but through Basilwizi we were able to build the Kujatana Kwesu Union warehouse where we are now having our meetings. Our aim is to be able to stock fish and kapenta. Even if we don’t have funds to be able to stock fish and kapenta at the moment, at least we have a central point to meet and work from, “he added. Some of the cooperatives within Kujatana Kwesu Union are already giving back to the community, namely Tyuunga Cooperative which is assisting 60 primary school pupils with their education in six different schools and Buumi Bwesu Cooperative which is assisting 55 pupils.

         “I’m happy that people come and seek guidance from our lobby group. The village head, Samuel Mwinde, worked together with us and he helped mobilize people to build the classrooms” says Joice Mutale.
       </p>
       <p>
         Joice Mutale (40) lives with her husband, Kainos (41), and their five children in Luunga village. Her latest child, Trish Tayanda, is only eight months old and therefore she was joining us for the interview in the traditional African way tied to the back of her mother with a towel. Joice has been a chairperson of a local lobby group since 2012. Basilwizi has empowered the groups to work together with local leaders and politicians to push for development in their area. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Joice wanted to improve the conditions for her two daughters and all the other children at Luunga Primary School, so she joined the group, when she heard about the work they were doing. Luunga village is in the rural area of Tyunga in Binga district. As many other rural areas in Binga, the people of Tyunga are facing severe problems regarding poverty, lack of education and other social issues. Basilwizi has worked in the area for several years. Together with her group, Joice, managed to make sure that proper classrooms were being built at the school. With the guidance of the lobby group the community managed to raise money from UNICEF and donations from households in the area. Now the school has a building with two classrooms and the children have a proper roof over their heads, school tables and big blackboards.

         On the 13th of August 2016, the Tonga people witnessed a historic milestone of their life time, through participating in the launch of Basilwizi book ‘The Zambezi Refrain, Lweendo LwaBasilwizi and adopting the new 5 year strategic plan for Basilwizi. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Over the past 13 years, Basilwizi Trust has been working with communities in Hwange, Binga, Gokwe north and Gokwe south and Nyaminyami in building their capacities to champion their own development. Consequently, in the past two years, Basilwizi undertook an exercise to document the people’s struggles for development as experienced in the field and presented these in a book entitled ‘The Zambezi Valley Refrain, ’Lweendo LwaBasilwizi’. It is this book that culminated to the event of the 13th of August 2016, at Simatelele Secondary School.
